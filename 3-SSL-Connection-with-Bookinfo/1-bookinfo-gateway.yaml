      # Note: Both foo-com-public.pem and foo-com-privatekey.pem in Example 8-16 are long-lived certificates for foo.com 
      # such as you would get from a CA like Let’s Encrypt. 
      # Unfortunately, Istio doesn’t handle these types of certificates today, 
      # so you need to mount any certificates that a Gateway must serve into the workload’s filesystem. 
      # Also, note that we updated both the port and protocol to match.
